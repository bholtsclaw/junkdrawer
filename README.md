JUNKDRAWER
==========

This is our little `digital junkdrawer` , Various small utilities I've either written or picked up sometime over the last few years. If they are in here then I should *generally* still be keeping them all updated and may add more myself or on request, if thats no longer the case then into the recycling pule the pool code goes not to collect dust years after its usefulness. helpers
Who knows, this may actually catch on. :P



```
Mostly one-liner bash scripts or a few fairly complex, especially when used togather php cli scripts,
Helper Scripts, Programs, Configs, and Templates for various things.
